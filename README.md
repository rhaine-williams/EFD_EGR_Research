**Predicting Academic Success in Engineering Courses**

This repository contains the code  for a research project aimed at predicting academic success in engineering courses. The project was conducted by Rhaine Williams during her time as a GRA at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University for the Engineering Fundamentals Department.

**Overview**

The goal of this project was to develop predictive models that could identify factors contributing to academic success in engineering courses. The team used data from previous semesters of EGR 100 and EGR 120 courses to train and test machine learning algorithms.

**Data**

The data used in this project includes demographic information, prior academic achievement, and performance data for each student in the EGR 100 and EGR 120 courses.

**Code**

The code used to analyze the data and develop predictive models is included in the "code" folder. It includes scripts for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning model development.

**Results**

The results of the analysis and predictive models results will be displayed in EFD_EGR_PredictiveModeling.ipynb file. This includes the data evaluation metrics for the predictive models.

**Requirements**

This project requires Python 3 and the following Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn. The required versions of these libraries are included in the "requirements.txt" file.

**Usage**

To run the code and reproduce the results of this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine

2. Navigate to the "code" folder and run the scripts in the following order:

    - EFD_EGR_DataCleaning.ipynb
    - EFD_EGR_Statistics.ipynb
    - EFD_EGR_PredictiveModeling.ipynb

The results will be displayed in EFD_EGR_PredictiveModeling.ipynb.
